## Documentation on setting up ESLint in VSCode

  - Go to VSCode 
  - Extensions (on left sidebar) 
  - Search for ESLint 
  - Install the extension
  - Enable it across the JavaScript project
  
## Testing 


-   The endpoint `usertest` which follows the same schema as the `users/` endpoint, must be used for testing
-   All other endpoints except `usertest` should involve methods which **must not** change the data on the server (read-only)
-   To test the endpoints provided by the application, tools such as [postman](https://www.postman.com/) can be used
