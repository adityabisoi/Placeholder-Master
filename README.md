## Testing <img src="https://github.com/Samridhi-98/Images/blob/master/Images/test.svg" width="3%">

-   The endpoint `usertest` which follows the same schema as the `users/` endpoint, must be used for testing
-   All other endpoints except `usertest` should involve methods which **must not** change the data on the server (read-only)
